## File Finding

### Fuzzy Finding with Snacks.picker

The configuration uses snacks.picker for all fuzzy finding needs.

| Key | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `<leader><leader>` | Switch buffers (double tap space) |
| `<leader>ff` | Find files in project |
| `<leader>fg` | Find git files only |
| `<leader>fr` | Recent files |
| `<leader>/` | Search text in project (grep) |

### Picker Controls
When in picker:

- `<C-v>` - Open in vertical split
- `<C-x>` - Open in horizontal split

### Search Tips
- Use spaces for fuzzy matching: `user controller` finds `UserController.go`

## Navigation Tips

### Efficient Workflow
1. Use Harpoon for core files you're actively editing
2. Use Flash (`s`) for visible jumps
3. Use fuzzy finder for everything else
4. Pin important buffers to keep them accessible

### Speed Tips
- `<leader><space>` is fastest for known files
- `s` + 2 chars beats scrolling every time
- Harpoon + number keys for instant switching
- Recent files (`<leader>fr`) for previous work

### Organization
- Let bufferline group your files automatically
- Use explorer for understanding project structure
- Outline for navigating within large files
- Marks for specific code locations
